# odin-recipes
<h2>Welcome to my first coding project!</h2>
<p> In this project I made a recipe web page using html to showcase some of my favourite foods. Recipe imagery is my own and recipes were adapted from  available online resources.</p>
<h3>A couple of take aways from this exercise<h/3>
<ul>
<li>I struggled to use git and track my changes ( I think these turned out okay but not 100% positive)</li>
<li>Proud of myself for remembering to make home buttons on the recipe pages and for not forgetting the alt text on images</li>
<li>I fully commited to using the terminal for my folders and changes. I even consulted stack overflow to find out how to change a file from .png to .jpg and how to resize the image</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for checking out my project!</p>
